Okay, this sprint plan looks like a solid starting point! It breaks down the initial user stories into manageable tasks and focuses on achieving a demonstrable outcome within a reasonable timeframe. Let's proceed with this plan.

To make it even more actionable, let's format it as a markdown checklist that you can use to track progress during the sprint.

### Sprint Plan - Recipe Agent Platform MVP - Sprint 1

**Sprint Goal:** Implement basic workflow orchestration in `RecipeAgentService` and a functional `recipe_search` step for the `recipe_workflow_full` workflow, enabling end-to-end testing of workflow initiation and the first step.

**Sprint Duration:** 1 week (Adjustable)

**Sprint Backlog (Tasks Checklist):**

**1. Workflow Command Handling Implementation (User Stories 1.1 - 1.4):**

*   [x] **Task 1.1: Define `workflow_initiate` Message Schema (Story 1.1)**
    *   [x] Create `docs/dev/message-schemas.md` file.
    *   [x] Define JSON schema for `workflow_initiate` message in `message-schemas.md`.
    *   [x] Review and confirm schema definition.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

*   [x] **Task 1.2: Implement `workflow_commands` Queue Consumer (Story 1.2)**
    *   [x] Add `pika` dependency to `RecipeAgentService` `requirements.txt`.
    *   [x] Implement RabbitMQ consumer in `RecipeAgentService` to connect to `workflow_commands` queue.
    *   [x] Set up environment variables for RabbitMQ connection.
    *   [x] Implement basic message acknowledgement.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 1 day*

*   [x] **Task 1.3: Implement `workflow_initiate` Message Parsing and Validation (Story 1.3)**
    *   [x] Implement JSON parsing of incoming messages in consumer callback.
    *   [x] Implement validation logic against `workflow_initiate` schema.
    *   [x] Implement error logging and message rejection for invalid messages.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 1 day*

*   [x] **Task 1.4: Workflow Instance Creation on `workflow_initiate` (Story 1.4)**
    *   [x] Implement workflow instance object (Python dictionary) creation.
    *   [x] Generate `workflow_id` (UUID).
    *   [x] Populate initial workflow object attributes from message and defaults.
    *   [x] Store workflow instance in in-memory dictionary.
    *   [x] Implement logging of workflow initiation.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 1 day*

**2. `recipe_search` Step Implementation (User Stories 2.1 - 2.2 & 3.1):**

*   [x] **Task 2.1: Implement Basic `search_recipes` Function (Story 3.1)**
    *   [x] Create `search_recipes(search_query)` function in `RecipeAgentService`.
    *   [x] Hardcode 2-3 recipe website base URLs.
    *   [x] Return a fixed list of recipe URLs (ignore `search_query` for now).
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

*   [x] **Task 2.2: Implement `_execute_recipe_search_step` Function (Story 2.1)**
    *   [x] Create `_execute_recipe_search_step(workflow_instance)` function in `RecipeAgentService`.
    *   [x] Implement logic to call `search_recipes()` and update workflow state.
    *   [x] Update `workflow_instance` attributes: `context_data["recipe_search_results"]`, `current_step`, `status`, `last_updated_timestamp`.
    *   [x] Implement logging for step completion.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 1 day*

*   [x] **Task 2.3: Trigger `recipe_search` Step on Workflow Initiation (Story 2.2)**
    *   [x] Modify `workflow_initiate` consumer callback to call `_execute_recipe_search_step()` after workflow instance creation.
    *   [x] Set initial `status` to "running" and `current_step` to "recipe_search" upon workflow initiation.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

**3. Basic Logging Setup (User Stories 4.1 - 4.2):**

*   [x] **Task 3.1: Configure Basic Logging (Story 4.1)**
    *   [x] Initialize `logging` library in `RecipeAgentService`.
    *   [x] Set up basic console logging with INFO level.
    *   [x] Include timestamps in log messages.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

*   [x] **Task 3.2: Implement Workflow Event Logging (Story 4.2)**
    *   [x] Add logging statements for workflow initiation, step start/end, and errors.
    *   [x] Include `workflow_id` in all relevant log messages.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

**Sprint Goal Review & Testing:**

*   [x] **Task 4.1: End-to-End Testing of Workflow Initiation and `recipe_search` Step (Story 6 from previous set)**
    *   [x] Deploy updated `RecipeAgentService` to Kubernetes.
    *   [x] Manually publish a `workflow_initiate` message to the `workflow_commands` queue.
    *   [x] Verify in `RecipeAgentService` logs: Message processing, workflow instance creation, `recipe_search` step execution, state updates.
    *   *Estimated Effort: 0.5 days*

**Timeline (Example 5-day week):**

*   **Day 1:** Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 3.1
*   **Day 2:** Tasks 1.3, 1.4, 3.2
*   **Day 3:** Tasks 2.1, 2.2
*   **Day 4:** Task 2.3, Task 4.1
*   **Day 5:** Buffer, bug fixing, documentation, sprint review.
