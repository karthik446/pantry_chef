# Project Current State - Recipe Agent Platform (MVP)

**Date:** 2025-02-09

**Project Goal:** Develop an MVP of the Recipe Agent Platform, focusing on the `recipe_workflow_full` workflow to search, scrape, and save recipes.

**Current Status Summary:**

The project is in the early stages of development.  The foundational infrastructure is in place, and the high-level architecture is defined.  The focus now is on implementing the core workflow orchestration logic and the initial agent functionalities within the `RecipeAgentService`.

**Implemented Components:**

*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   Kubernetes cluster deployed and running.
    *   RabbitMQ message broker deployed and running.
    *   PostgreSQL database deployed and running.
    *   Redis cache deployed and running.
    *   Pantry Chef API (Go) deployed and functional (endpoints for saving recipes, ingredients, etc. are assumed to be in place).
    *   Monitoring setup via New Relic.
    *   Opentelemetry setup on Go API.
*   **Recipe Agent Service (Python):**
    *   Deployed as a Kubernetes pod.
    *   Basic RabbitMQ connectivity and message consumption framework is in place.
    *   Intended to act as the workflow orchestrator for `recipe_workflow_full` and future workflows.

**Partially Implemented / Conceptual Components:**

*   **Workflow Orchestration Logic (`RecipeAgentService`):**
    *   Workflow concept and object definition are defined.
    *   `workflow_commands` queue and consumer are being implemented.
    *   Workflow state management (in-memory initially) is being implemented.
    *   Step logic for `recipe_workflow_full` (search, scrape, save) is not yet implemented.
*   **Search Agent Logic:**
    *   Conceptualized as a component to find recipe URLs based on search queries.
    *   Initial MVP implementation of `search_recipes` function will be within `RecipeAgentService` using hardcoded recipe sites (for testing).
*   **Recipe Scraping Agent Logic:**
    *   Conceptualized as a component to scrape structured recipe data from URLs.
    *   Initial MVP implementation of `scrape_recipe_data` function will be within `RecipeAgentService`, referencing old `recipe_agent_old.py` code for scraping logic.
*   **Nutrition Agent Logic:**
    *   Conceptualized as a separate service to gather nutrition information.
    *   Not yet implemented for MVP, planned for future extension.
*   **Message Queues:**
    *   `recipe_searches` queue is in place.
    *   `recipe_search_done` exchange/queue is in place.
    *   `workflow_commands` queue is being implemented.
    *   `nutrition_for_ingredient` queue is planned for future nutrition feature.
*   **Database Schema:**
    *   Database is set up.
    *   Schema for recipes and ingredients is assumed to exist in the Pantry Chef API.
    *   Schema for nutrition data will be needed for future nutrition feature.

**Next Steps / To-Do Items for MVP:**

1.  **Implement `workflow_commands` queue consumer and `workflow_initiate` message handling in `RecipeAgentService` (User Stories 1.1 - 1.4).**
2.  **Implement basic in-memory workflow state management in `RecipeAgentService` (User Story 3 from previous set).**
3.  **Implement `recipe_search` step logic and trigger it on workflow initiation in `RecipeAgentService` (User Stories 2.1 - 2.2).**
4.  **Implement basic `search_recipes` function using hardcoded recipe sites (User Story 3.1).**
5.  **Implement basic logging in `RecipeAgentService` and log workflow events (User Stories 4.1 - 4.2).**
6.  **Basic testing of the `recipe_workflow_full` workflow end-to-end (from `workflow_initiate` message to `recipe_search` step completion).**
7.  **Implement `recipe_scraping` step logic and `scrape_recipe_data` function (next after `recipe_search` is working).**
8.  **Implement Recipe API integration for saving scraped recipes (after scraping is working).**
9.  **Implement `recipe_search_done` message publishing (after saving to API is working).**

**Longer-Term Goals (Beyond MVP):**

*   Implement `NutritionAgent` and `ingredients_nutrition_gather_workflow`.
*   Implement persistent workflow state management (database/Redis).
*   Develop UI integration for real-time updates.
*   Implement robust error handling, retries, and dead-letter queues.
*   Set up comprehensive monitoring and observability.
*   Refactor `SearchAgent` and `RecipeScrapingAgent` into separate services.
*   Develop a Workflow Management UI.
*   Implement more workflow types.

**Risks and Challenges:**

*   Complexity of implementing workflow orchestration logic within `RecipeAgentService`.
*   Potential issues with scraping websites (website changes, rate limiting).
*   Integration with external APIs (search, nutrition).
*   Ensuring robustness and scalability of the platform.

**Overall:**

The project is progressing well with the infrastructure in place.  The next phase is crucial to implement the core workflow logic and agent functionalities to achieve a functional MVP for the `recipe_workflow_full` workflow.  Focusing on incremental development and testing will be key to success.
