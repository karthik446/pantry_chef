## Major Accomplishments

### Recipe Agent Service Improvements

1. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - Implemented full `recipe_workflow_full` with proper state management
   - Successfully handling workflow commands through RabbitMQ
   - Metrics collection and publishing for each workflow step
   - Reference: workflow_orchestrator.py (lines 192-290)

2. **Search Agent**
   - Replaced SmoleAgent with direct DuckDuckGo integration
   - Better URL filtering and domain exclusion
   - Improved retry logic and error handling
   - Metrics tracking for search duration and attempts

3. **Recipe Scraping**
   - Parallel recipe scraping implementation
   - Structured data extraction with validation
   - Error handling and metrics collection per recipe
   - Integration with Gemini 2.0 Flash model for AI-assisted scraping

### Infrastructure & Integration

1. **Service-to-Service Authentication**
   - Implemented Kubernetes ServiceAccount-based authentication
   - Proper token management and validation
   - Secure API client with retry logic
   - Reference: system-design_v1.md (lines 30-53)

2. **Message Queue Architecture**
   - Working queues:
     - `workflow_commands`: For workflow initiation
     - `metrics_queue`: For metrics collection
   - Proper message consumption and error handling
   - Reference: current-state.md (lines 43-46)

3. **Metrics & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive metrics collection for:
     - Search operations
     - Scraping operations
     - Workflow execution
     - API interactions
   - Integration with New Relic for monitoring

## What's Working

1. **Complete Recipe Search Workflow**
   - User initiates search → Workflow created → URLs found → Recipes scraped → Saved to API
   - Proper error handling and state management throughout
   - Reference: sequence-diagrams.md (lines 46-82)

2. **Data Flow**
   - Search queries properly tracked and stored
   - Recipe deduplication based on source URLs
   - Structured recipe data saved with proper validation
   - Metrics collected at each step

3. **System Reliability**
   - Retry logic for failed operations
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - State management for workflow tracking
   - Service authentication working reliably

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Search Results**
   - DuckDuckGo search sometimes returns limited results
   - Need to implement better search result filtering
   - Some domains still need to be added to exclusion list

2. **Recipe Scraping**
   - Some complex recipe sites still fail to scrape
   - AI-assisted scraping needs optimization
   - Performance improvements needed for parallel scraping

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Need to implement persistent workflow state storage
   - Better handling of service restarts needed
   - Monitoring coverage could be improved

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priorities**
   - Implement persistent workflow state storage
   - Optimize AI-assisted recipe scraping
   - Improve search result quality

2. **Future Enhancements**
   - Implement NutritionAgent integration
   - Add real-time UI updates
   - Expand monitoring coverage

## Technical Debt

1. **Testing**
   - Need more unit tests for workflow orchestration
   - Integration tests for full workflow
   - Performance testing for parallel operations

2. **Documentation**
   - API documentation needs updating
   - Workflow state transitions need documentation
   - Metrics documentation needed

This version represents significant progress from January, particularly in workflow orchestration, service authentication, and metrics collection. The system is now more robust and observable, though there are still areas for improvement.
