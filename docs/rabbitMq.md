Using RabbitMQ for async communication between the API and agents is a great approach. Here's why:
For API to Agent communication:
API can publish recipe processing requests to RabbitMQ queues
Agents can subscribe to these queues and process recipes asynchronously
Decouples the API from direct agent dependencies
Provides natural load balancing and fault tolerance
For Agent to API communication:
Agents can publish processing results back to different queues
API can subscribe to these result queues
Provides a clean separation of concerns
Handles agent failures gracefully
